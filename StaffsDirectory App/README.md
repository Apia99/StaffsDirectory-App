This app is titled Directory App. When an employee opens the app, they're presented with a screen that will show them a list of the staff members within the company along with name, profile image and title. After the initial screen when a user tapped on the profile images of those employees a detailed view will come up which displays more information about the staff members in details. In addition, there is a second function separate from the staff members which contains information about the rooms used within the company such as the ID, number of occupancy and track whether these rooms are occupied or not with a red/green label next to them. As you can see on the above images the sequences show you the process of how to get to each screen information from start to Finish.
